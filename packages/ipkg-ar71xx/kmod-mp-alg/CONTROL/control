Description:  Kernel modules that provide several different algorithms for multipath
 route selection from the route cache. The iproute "mpath" argument allows
 specifying which algorithm to use for routes.
 quagga (at least <=0.99.6) requires a multipath patch to support this
 cached mp route feature.
